    <h2>Ralph Mctell - Streets of London</h2>
</header>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        Have you seen the old man, in the closed-down market
        picking up the papers, with his worn-out shoes?
        In his eyes you see no pride, and held loosely by his side
        yesterday's papers, telling yesterday's news

        So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
        and say for you that the sun don't shine?
        Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
        I'll show you something, to make you change your mind

        Have you seen the old gal, who walks the streets of London
        dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?
        She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
        Carrying her home, in two carrier bags

        So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
        and say for you that the sun don't shine?
        Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
        I'll show you something, to make you change your mind

        And in the all-night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
        some old man sitting there, all on his own
        Looking at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup
        Each day lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone

        So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
        and say for you that the sun don't shine?
        Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
        I'll show you something, to make you change your mind

        And have you seen the old man, outside the seaman's mission?
        His memory's fading, with those medal ribbons that he wears
        And in our winter city, the rain cries little pity
        For one more forgotten hero, and a world that doesn't care

        So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
        and say for you that the sun don't shine?
        Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
        I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
        I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
