        Everyone is trying to get to the bar
        The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven
        The band in heaven they play my favorite song
        Play it one more time, play it all night long

        Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
        Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens

        There is a party, everyone is there
        Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
        When this party is over it will start again
        It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same

        Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens

        When this kiss is over it will start again
        It will not be any different, it will be exactly the
        It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
        could be so exciting, could be so much fun

        Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
        Heaven, Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens
