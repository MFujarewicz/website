Everyone is trying to get to the bar           D D e e
The name of the bar, the bar is called heaven  A G G D
The band in heaven they play my favorite song  D D e e
Play it one more time, play it all night long  A G G D


Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens h a C G
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens h a C G

There is a party, everyone is there                        D D e e
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time               A G G D
When this party is over it will start again                D D e e
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same  A G G D

Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens h a C G

When this kiss is over it will start again                  D D e e
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same   A G G D
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all                    D D e e
could be so exciting, could be so much fun                  A G G D


Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens h a C G
Heaven, Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens h a C G
