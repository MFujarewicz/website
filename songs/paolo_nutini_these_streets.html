    <h2>Paolo Nutini - These Streets</h2>
</header>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        Cross the border, into the big bad world
        Where it takes you about an hour just to cross the road,
        Just to stumble across another poor old sole,
        From the dreary old lanes to the High St madness,
        I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
        And it's harder than you think to believe this sadness,
        It creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night

        Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous,
        Suddenly the air smells much greener now
        And I'm walking around with a half pack of cigarettes
        Searching for the change I've lost somehow

        These Streets, have too many names for me
        I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
        I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know

        Where'd the days go when all we did was play
        And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all,
        Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall
        From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square,
        You see millions of people with millions of cares
        And I stuggle to the train to make my way home
        I look at the people as they sit there alone

        Life is good and the sun is shining,
        Everybody floats to their ideal place
        And the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them,
        Trying to pretend that they've got some space.
